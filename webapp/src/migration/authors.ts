			"Hi, I am Nishad Kinhikar, my life has been a bit like an introvert's journey in an extrovert's world. Back when I was just 20, I used to shy away from random interactions. But one day I decided to take a leap of faith during my university days by going on a Cultural Exchange trip to Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis experience was like opening a door to a whole new world of personal growth and unforgettable experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince childhood, I've always loved watching new Marathi plays, watching them with my family and falling in love with the art form. It got me thinkingâ€”how could I contribute to the growth of Marathi theatre? And that's when the idea for VeryFirstTale was born.\r\n\r\n\r\nVeryFirstTale aims to capture the first hand and true essence of all my personal experiences, be it travelling or watching a new Marathi Play, to create helpful content as well as to provide valuable and honest tips to my readers about my enthusiasm for watching a new Marathi Play or my next travel adventure.",
